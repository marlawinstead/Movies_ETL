# Movies_ETL
Using Jupyter Notebook and PostgresSQL to create databases

Overview

In this module, we are using the data pipeline process, known as Extract, Transform and Load (ETL) to create databases. Amazing Prime, a platform for streaming videos, wants to develop an algorithm to predict which low budget movies will perform well. The goal is for them to buy the rights to the low budget movies that are predicted to become popular.

Results

The results of the ETL process are in the form of two tables as shown below. The movies table resulted in 6,052 rows, or 6052 unique movie titles. The ratings table yielded 26,024,289 rows of data, which is the number of viewer ratings.
